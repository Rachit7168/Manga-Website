**Hello, I’m Rachit Makwana.**

Welcome, and thank you for checking out my project!

---

🛠️ **About the Project**
This is my first complete web development project, and I’ve built it entirely from scratch using Flask. It's still a work in progress, but the core features are functional and improving daily.

Once the development is complete, I will:
- Open-source the entire codebase
- Add detailed comments and documentation for better understanding
- Make it completely free to use and learn from

🔍 **What You Will Learn**
This project is a great opportunity to understand the foundational concepts of **user authentication**, including:

- **Login, Logout, and Signup modules**  
- How **user input and output** flow through a Flask-based application  
- How **Python files interact with HTML templates** using Flask routes and Jinja templating  
- Basic principles of **form handling**, **session management**, and **routing**

It's ideal for beginners who want to explore how full-stack web applications function at a core level.
